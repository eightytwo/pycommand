                     [ pycommand ]

pycommand is the result of learning to use the pygame
library and is a very rudimentary clone of the classic
Missile Command game.


At this stage there really aren't any gameplay rules other
than not letting a missile reach the bottom of the screen.
If this happens the game will end. To avoid this, place
defence targets in the path of the missiles to stop them.


Controls
--------
 * move the crosshairs with the mouse
 * click to place a defence target at the current mouse
   position
 * escape to quit
